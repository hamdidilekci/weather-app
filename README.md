# Getting Started with `www.weather-forecastr.netlify.app`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## The project was developed using, `Context-API, axios, bootstrap, css.`

## The weather report reflects the next week, starting from the current day.

## When the page is first opened, the weather report of my hometown Adıyaman/Çelikhan is displayed by default.

## If location permission is granted when the page is first opened, your location is automatically entered in the input field by clicking the location button. 

## It is enough to press the enter key to bring the reports of the location entered in the input.
